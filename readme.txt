IEMonitor By Richard Friend

You must load group1.vpg, as the test project references the IEMonitor.vbp.

Or you can load IEEvents.vbp and complile it, then open project1.vbp remove the referance to IEMonitor.vbp and add one to IEMonitor.ocx.

Any Problems Questions or information on a new unreleased version - contact me richard.3.friend@bt.com


Thanks :o)
